function [J, grad] = lrCostFunction(theta, X, y, lambda)
%LRCOSTFUNCTION Compute cost and gradient for logistic regression with 
%regularization
%   J = LRCOSTFUNCTION(theta, X, y, lambda) computes the cost of using
%   theta as the parameter for regularized logistic regression and the
%   gradient of the cost w.r.t. to the parameters. 

% Initialize some useful values
m = length(y); % number of training examples

% You need to return the following variables correctly 
J = 0;
grad = zeros(size(theta));
regularization_theta = theta;
regularization_theta(1,1) = 0;

pos = find(y==1); neg = find(y==0);
%size(X)
%size(theta)

intermediate = ( sum(log(sigmoid(X(pos,:) * theta))) + sum(log(1 .- (sigmoid(X(neg,:) * theta)))) ) / (-m) ; 

J = intermediate + (lambda/(2* m)) * (regularization_theta' * regularization_theta);

grad = ( ( X' *(sigmoid(X * theta) - y ) ) / m ) + ( (lambda/m) * regularization_theta );


% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Compute the cost of a particular choice of theta.
%               You should set J to the cost.
%               Compute the partial derivatives and set grad to the partial
%               derivatives of the cost w.r.t. each parameter in theta
%
% Hint: The computation of the cost function and gradients can be
%       efficiently vectorized. For example, consider the computation
%
%           sigmoid(X * theta)
%
%       Each row of the resulting matrix will contain the value of the
%       prediction for that example. You can make use of this to vectorize
%       the cost function and gradient computations. 
%
% Hint: When computing the gradient of the regularized cost function, 
%       there're many possible vectorized solutions, but one solution
%       looks like:
%           grad = (unregularized gradient for logistic regression)
%           temp = theta; 
%           temp(1) = 0;   % because we don't add anything for j = 0  
%           grad = grad + YOUR_CODE_HERE (using the temp variable)
